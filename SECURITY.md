How does Al
work?
 Al is built on the analysis of big
data sets that contain too much
information for any human to analyze
on their own in a reasonable time. An

Al model is built to identify patterns in
those data sets, and then use those
patterns to predict future or additional
patterns. Al models use probability
and statistical analysis in order to do
so. Some Al models are good enough
at this to mimic human behaviors.

Theoretically, Al may go beyond this
one day and be able to "think" original
thoughts. Determining when that
point is reached is, in some respects,
a philosophical question more so than
a technical one.
